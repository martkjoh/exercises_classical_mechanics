    A very thin rectangular slab has been placed in the $xyz$-coordinates system, such that the origin is in one of the slab corners, and the sides are along the $x$- and $y$-axes. The corresponding side lengths are $a$ and $b$. Since the slab is very thin, we can assume that $z=0$ throughout.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Evaluate the individual elements of the inertia tensor.
        \item Set $a = b$, and solve for the principal moments of inertia, and the corresponding principal axes.
    \end{enumerate}

        (Exam Aug. 2018)\\
        A very thin rectangular slab (see figure) rotates with an angular velocity vector $\boldsymbol\omega$ parallel to its diagonal. The principal axes $1$ and $2$ are parallel to the slab edges, as indicated in the figure,while axis $3$ is perpendicular to the slab, and goes through its center. The side lengths of the slab are $a$ and $b$, with the principal moments of inertia

        \begin{equation*}
            I = 
            \begin{pmatrix}
                I_{1} & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & I_{2} & 0 \\

            \end{pmatrix}
        \end{equation*}
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Derive the angular momentum vector $\mathbf{L}$ of the slab, in terms of $a, b, M$ and $\omega$.
            \item What is the angle $\alpha$ between $\mathbf L$ and $\boldsymbol \omega$?
            \item What is the rotational kinetic energy $T$?

    \section{Cone rolling on a plane}
    (Exam Dec. 2016) \\ \\
    We shall consider the motion of a solid cone that is rolling on the surface ($xy$-plane), without slipping. The center of mass of the cone is situated on the symmetry axis $x_3$, which goes through the center of the bottom of the cone. It is at a distance $\ell$ from the origin $O$. The height of the cone is $H$, and the radius of the bottom of the cone is $R$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Calculate the velocity of the center of mass, $V_{CM}$ as a function of $\ell, \alpha$ and $\dv{t} \phi =\dot \phi$.
        \item Explain why the angular velocity vector $\boldsymbol \omega$ of the rolling cone is directed along the line $OA$, the line of contact between the cone and the $xy$-plane. Show that 
        \begin{equation*}
            \omega = |\boldsymbol \omega | = \frac{\cos(\alpha)}{\tan(\alpha)} \dot \phi
        \end{equation*}
        \item find the component of $\boldsymbol \omega $ along the principal axes (symmetry axes) of the cone, $\mathbf{x}_i$.
        \item The principal moment of inertia of the cone, for rotation around the point $O$ is
            \begin{equation*}
                I = 
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    I_{1} & 0 & 0 \\
                    0 & I_{2} & 0 \\
                    0 & 0 & I_{3} \\
                \end{pmatrix}
                = \frac{3}{10} M 
                \begin{pmatrix}
                    \frac{1}{2}(R^2 + 4H^2)& 0 & 0 \\
                    0 & \frac{1}{2}(R^2 + 4H^2)& 0 \\
                    0 & 0 & R^2\\
                \end{pmatrix}
                ,
            \end{equation*}
            where $M$ is the mass of the cone. Calculate the kinetic energy of the cone as a function of $M, H, \alpha$ and $\dot \phi$.
    \end{enumerate}
