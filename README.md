Exercises in [TFY4345 - Classical Mechanics](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TFY4345#tab=omEmnet) at NTNU. Exercises by [Jaakko Akola](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/jaakkoa), typset and extended by Martin Johnsrud.


To always have an updated version of the exercises, use git to clone the perository, and then use git pull from time to time. Exercises i have finished to typeset are found in the [finished](finished/) folder, while the ones I am currently working on are in [in_progess](in_progress/) If you find errors, or there are things you think could be clarified, don't hesitate to contact me!
