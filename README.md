To always have an updated version of the exercises, use git to clone the perository, and then use git pusll from time to time. Exercises i have finished to typeset are found in the [finished](finished/) folder, while the ones I am currently working on are in [in_progess](in_progress/) If you find errors, or there are things you think could be clarified, don't hesitate to contact me!
